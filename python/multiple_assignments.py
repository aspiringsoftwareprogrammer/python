# multiple assignments = allows us to assign multiple 
# two diff ways to use multiple assignment: 
    # if you have diff values assign variables in order like below 

#name = "bro"
#age = 21
#race = "white"

name, age, race = "bro", 21, "white"

print(name)
print(age)
print(race)

    # if you have the same values across variables - then use the = sign 

#squidward = 30
#spongebob = 30 
#patrick = 30 

squidward = spongebob = patrick = 30

print(squidward)
print(spongebob)
print(patrick)
